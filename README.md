# Twitter_Internet_Speed_Bot
A script that uses Selenium to check the upload and download speed of the user's internet on a website.
After, it compares the speed observed from the internet speed test website to the speeds guaranteed by the provider. 
If the upload or download speed is lower, the script will log into the user's Twitter account using Selenium to tweet the internet provider.
